// initial render (the interaction-driven-content limitation documented in
// .ds-sync/storybook/SKILL.md §4a — compiled previews never run play). The
// storybook reference screenshot is captured POST-play, so each story here
// mirrors the story's JSX verbatim but with `defaultValue` set to that
// post-play end state (a real prop, not a fidelity workaround) instead of
// the story's own pre-interaction initial value. See
// .design-sync/learnings/layout.md for the computed end-state per story.
