## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Disconnect withdraws tools and reconnect requires fresh discovery

When an MCP client disconnects, llame SHALL atomically withdraw every tool from that server before scheduling a reconnect. Reconnect attempts SHALL run in the background, remain single-flight, and SHALL reset the attempt counter only after initialization plus complete discovery and admission succeed.

For a remote transport, reconnect SHALL use AWS Full Jitter: for zero-based failure attempt `n`, sample uniformly from zero through `min(5 minutes, 1 second * 2^n)`, and attempts SHALL continue indefinitely while the server remains configured. For a local stdio transport, attempts SHALL instead be bounded as specified in "stdio launch failures retry a bounded number of times", because an unbounded loop there respawns a child process rather than reopening a socket, and the most common cause is a configuration error that no number of retries resolves. A worker attempt that observes the server already unavailable or reconnecting SHALL use that runtime state immediately rather than wait for or initiate a reconnect. Reconnection SHALL create a fresh client and session and SHALL publish no tool until complete fresh discovery and admission succeeds. A timer or cached declaration MUST NOT re-advertise a stale tool.

Every per-server asynchronous operation and callback SHALL be fenced by the current lifecycle generation and exact client identity. A callback from an older client or generation MUST NOT publish or withdraw the current catalog, close the current client, change current lifecycle state, or schedule reconnect/state work. It MAY release only resources captured from its own stale generation. Runtime shutdown SHALL be terminal: it SHALL invalidate every current generation and client identity before cancellation and close begin, and no callback after shutdown starts MAY publish or withdraw a catalog, change lifecycle state, or schedule reconnect/refresh work even if it captured the formerly current generation.

While ready, each instance-managed server SHALL undergo complete discovery periodically in the background using a one-hour base interval with independently sampled ±20% jitter per server, process, and cycle, producing a 48–72 minute delay. A stdio server that has settled as unavailable SHALL also be scheduled on that same periodic occasion, using the same interval and jitter, with its tick attempting recovery — a fresh child process and complete discovery — rather than a refresh of a catalog it no longer has. This interval SHALL NOT be operator-configurable in this capability. A new turn SHALL perform no MCP network I/O and SHALL immediately bind the latest atomically published catalog even if a refresh is in flight. Successful refresh SHALL publish only after complete pagination and admission; declaration additions, removals, and drift become visible to the next turn after that atomic publication. A discovery failure SHALL immediately withdraw the affected server rather than retain a known-failed catalog.

#### Scenario: Disconnect withdraws the server catalog

- **WHEN** a connected MCP transport closes
- **THEN** all tools from that server are immediately absent from newly prepared worker catalogs
- **AND** unrelated tools remain available

#### Scenario: Reconnect publishes only fresh declarations

- **WHEN** a reconnect initializes successfully
- **THEN** no tool becomes available again until fresh complete discovery and admission succeeds

#### Scenario: Stale lifecycle callbacks cannot clobber recovery

- **WHEN** an old client's refresh completion or transport-close callback arrives after a newer generation is ready
- **THEN** the callback releases only its captured old resources
- **AND** the newer client, catalog, timers, and ready state remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Reconnect backoff follows Full Jitter

- **WHEN** reconnect attempt `n` is scheduled after failure
- **THEN** its delay is sampled uniformly between zero and `min(5 minutes, 1 second * 2^n)`
- **AND** a successful initialization without successful complete discovery does not reset `n`

#### Scenario: Known outage does not delay a turn

- **WHEN** a new turn binds while a configured server is unavailable or reconnecting
- **THEN** the turn immediately records the affected eligible tools as unavailable
- **AND** it neither waits for nor starts a reconnect attempt

#### Scenario: Ready server refresh does not delay a turn

- **WHEN** a new turn binds while background discovery is in flight for a ready server
- **THEN** the turn immediately uses the last completely published catalog
- **AND** the refresh result applies atomically only to later turns

#### Scenario: Silent catalog change is observed in the background

- **WHEN** a ready server changes its tool catalog without disconnecting
- **THEN** the next successful periodic discovery after an independently jittered 48–72 minute delay atomically publishes the admitted change
- **AND** the first later turn compares and discloses the resulting availability transition

#### Scenario: Declaration drift withdraws only the tool

- **WHEN** an MCP tool's live declaration no longer canonically matches the source declaration retained in the currently executing attempt
- **THEN** that tool call settles as unavailable rather than executing a different contract
- **AND** the mismatch does not fail the entire Run or affect sibling tools

#### Scenario: Clean shutdown closes clients

- **WHEN** the API or dedicated worker shuts down
- **THEN** reconnect work is cancelled, catalogs are withdrawn, and every live MCP client is closed within a bounded shutdown path
- **AND** late callbacks release only captured resources and cannot publish, change state, or schedule work

Within an attempt, source-declaration equality and executor/lifecycle checks SHALL remain in memory. A new queue attempt SHALL resolve fresh rather than restore a declaration from the database. An attempt that fails before dispatching a model request SHALL not create an availability comparison baseline.
