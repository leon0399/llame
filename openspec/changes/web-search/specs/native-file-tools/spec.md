## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Web locators are fetched by the native read tool

The native `read` tool SHALL accept an absolute `http://` or `https://`
locator as its `path` and SHALL fetch it with the API process's own outbound
HTTP. No other web scheme SHALL be admitted, and `edit` and `write` SHALL
reject a web locator with `invalid_path` before any request. A submitted web
locator, after any fragment is cut and its selector is split off, SHALL be
normalized to its WHATWG URL serialization and requested as that text: an
uppercase scheme or host, a percent-encoded or Unicode host, an explicit
default port, a host's root dot, an empty path, unencoded path or query
characters, and percent-escapes in the path or query SHALL each be
normalized rather than refused, because none of them
addresses a different resource and refusing them cost a call that taught the
model nothing it could carry to the next locator. Path and query escapes
SHALL be normalized in one pass that yields a fixed point: a `%` that does not
begin a valid escape SHALL be encoded as `%25`, an escape of an unreserved
character (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`, `.`, `_`, `~`) SHALL be decoded, and every
other escape, `%2F` included, SHALL stay encoded with uppercase hexadecimal
digits, so normalizing the normalized text changes nothing and llame's
normalization forms no new escape. A fragment SHALL be cut
before anything else reads the locator, because the request drops it anyway.
What no normalization can repair SHALL still fail before any request: a text
that is not a URL, a scheme outside `http` and `https`, and userinfo, which
SHALL fail with `invalid_path` so the tool never sends credentials the model
embedded in a URL, and whose message SHALL NOT echo them. A suffix outside the
selector grammar SHALL fail with `invalid_selector` naming the working forms,
because the locator before that suffix is a URL this tool can request.

After the submitted locator is admitted and canonicalized, the read SHALL
consider the ordered, code-owned web adapters before the generic HTML and text
ladder. A matching adapter SHALL be selected without network I/O. `:raw` SHALL
bypass every adapter and retain the raw-response behavior below; `:outline`
SHALL NOT bypass an adapter, because it describes the document a plain read
of the same locator returns, so a claiming adapter's rendered document is the
outline's input. An adapter SHALL
not add a tool id, a second permission group, or a different source authority.
An adapter target is another derived locator and SHALL be admitted in its own right.

Because the text requested is no longer always the text submitted, the
permission decision SHALL be taken over both: any reject clause matching
either the submitted locator with its read selector removed or its normalized form SHALL refuse the call, so
a spelling cannot be arranged to miss a reject, while the allow SHALL be
decided on the normalized form, because an allow names the resource the call
will reach and the two texts are one resource. A redirect hop is a different
resource and SHALL keep being admitted in its own right, and every address a
request would connect to SHALL additionally be judged under the
address-admission requirement below. Availability and
restriction for fetching web locators through `read` SHALL come only from the `read` permission group's
`path` clauses: a prefix allow admits the web, and a prefix or domain reject
removes a host. This web-availability rule governs a `default`-mode attempt; under `bypass` the web is reachable without a `path` allow, as this capability's Purpose states. No web tool id, `tools.allowed` entry, configuration block, or
advertisement condition SHALL be added for fetching a web locator; `web_search`, specified by `web-search`, is a separate tool with its own allowlist entry, configuration, and permission group, and the `read` group's `path` clauses do not restrict it; a process that does not advertise
`read` SHALL NOT reach a URL through it. Each call SHALL fetch afresh: no
response or render SHALL be cached, and a later selector read of the same
locator SHALL issue a new request. The tool SHALL NOT consult `robots.txt` or
any publisher signal such as `content-signal`, and a fetch SHALL NOT be
represented as permission from the publisher. The scheme split and trailing
selector rules that protect a `scheme://` prefix SHALL apply unchanged: the
scheme's own colon is never read as a selector, and the shipped
trailing-selector split (the last colon after the last slash) governs the
rest, except that the `:raw` and `:outline` representation forms are
recognized before that last-colon fallback. A selector SHALL be split only from a locator that has a path and
carries no `?` and no `#`, so a colon inside a query is part of the URL
(`https://example.test/search?at=2026:10` is fetched as written) and the only
colon of a pathless locator opens its port: `https://example.test:88` is port
88, `https://example.test/:88` is line 88 of the site root, and
`https://example.test:88/:88` is line 88 served from port 88.
A literal colon in the last path segment of a query-free locator SHALL be
written as `%3A` (`https://w.example/wiki/Special%3ASearch`), because a
trailing colon is always read as a selector split and the shipped grammar
admits `raw`, `raw:<list>`, `N`, `N-M`, `N+K`, `N-`, `-K`, comma lists of
those, `outline`, `outline:N`, `outline:N-M`, `outline:N+K`, `outline:N-`, and
`outline:-K`, with `:<list>:raw` the same read as `:raw:<list>`: `Search`
is outside it, so `https://w.example/wiki/Special:Search`
fails as `invalid_selector`, while `https://w.example/docs/2024:10` selects
line 10 and `https://w.example/docs/2024:10-20` lines 10 through 20 of
`https://w.example/docs/2024`. A suffix `:outline` or `:outline:<range>` is
split as the outline representation before the last-colon fallback, so
`https://h.example/p:outline:5-40` requests `https://h.example/p` and scopes
the outline to rendered lines 5 through 40; a literal last-segment colon in a
path intended to end in `outline` SHALL be percent-encoded.
Each refusal that remains SHALL name the spelling that would work rather than
the rule that was broken: a selector written straight after the authority
(`https://example.test:1-5`, which is not a URL at all because `1-5` is not a
port) SHALL be answered with the authority's own serialization carrying that
selector (`https://example.test/:1-5`); a port that is not a number
(`https://example.test:abc/`) SHALL be answered by naming that rule and the
same locator without a port, rather than by the generic message, since the
locator is absolute and only its port is broken; a suffix that meant a line the
grammar cannot serve (`:12+`), or any other suffix outside it (`Search`), SHALL be answered with the forms, `N-` and
`-K` included, first and the literal colon's encoding second; and a selector
the render could not
serve — past its end, or with no line in it — SHALL be answered with the
number of lines the page rendered, which the model cannot know before reading
it.

#### Scenario: A web locator is fetched by the API process

- **WHEN** the model calls `read` with `https://example.test/guide`
- **THEN** the API process issues the request and returns the page content
- **AND** no native executor identity is required, bound, or reported

#### Scenario: A rejected cleartext scheme never reaches the network

- **WHEN** the `read` group rejects `path` matching `^http://` and the model reads `http://example.test/guide`
- **THEN** the call is rejected before any request is issued
- **AND** an admitted `https://` locator is unaffected by that reject

#### Scenario: A web locator is never mutated

- **WHEN** `edit` or `write` targets `https://example.test/guide`
- **THEN** it returns `invalid_path`
- **AND** no request is issued

#### Scenario: A noncanonical spelling is normalized, not refused

- **WHEN** the model reads `https://g%72okipedia.com/page`, `HTTPS://Example.test/guide`, `https://example.test:443/guide`, or `https://example.test./guide`
- **THEN** the read requests the normalized locator (`https://grokipedia.com/page`, `https://example.test/guide`) without a refusal first
- **AND** a reject clause written against the canonical spelling still refuses every one of those variants, because the decision is taken over the submitted text and the normalized text alike
- **AND** a reject clause written against the submitted spelling, such as one naming `%72`, also refuses

#### Scenario: An encoded unreserved character cannot slip past a path reject

- **WHEN** the `read` group rejects `path` matching `^https://example\.test/private` and the model reads `https://example.test/%70rivate`
- **THEN** the call is rejected before any request, because the normalized text is `https://example.test/private`
- **AND** `https://example.test/%%370rivate` is requested as `https://example.test/%2570rivate`, whose once-decoded path is the literal `/%70rivate` it named, so llame's normalization forms no new escape; a server that decodes a path twice can still read it as `/private`, which a path-scoped rule cannot bound
- **AND** `https://example.test/a%2fb` is requested as `https://example.test/a%2Fb`, still encoded

#### Scenario: A pathless host reads its port, a path reads its line

- **WHEN** the model reads `https://example.test:88`, which has no path for a selector to trail
- **THEN** the read requests `https://example.test:88/` on port 88, and the permission decision matched that same text
- **AND** `https://example.test/:88` requests the site root and returns line 88 of its render
- **AND** `https://example.test:88/:88` requests the root on port 88 and returns line 88 of it

#### Scenario: Userinfo in a locator fails closed

- **WHEN** the model reads `https://user:secret@example.test/guide`
- **THEN** the read returns `invalid_path` before any request
- **AND** no credential from the locator is sent to the host

#### Scenario: A colon in the last path segment is a selector unless encoded

- **WHEN** the model reads `https://w.example/wiki/Special:Search`
- **THEN** the read fails with `invalid_selector` and issues no request, because the split-off suffix is present but outside the grammar
- **AND** `https://w.example/wiki/Special%3ASearch` is fetched as written, while `https://w.example/docs/2024:10` selects line 10 and `https://w.example/docs/2024:10-20` lines 10 through 20 of `https://w.example/docs/2024`
- **AND** `https://w.example/wiki/Special:-5` is the last five rendered lines of `https://w.example/wiki/Special`, and the literal spelling of that same resource is `https://w.example/wiki/Special%3A-5`

#### Scenario: Outline representation splits before the last-colon fallback

- **WHEN** the model reads `https://h.example/p:outline:5-40`
- **THEN** the request targets `https://h.example/p` and the outline is scoped to rendered lines 5 through 40
- **AND** the `:outline` text is not sent as part of the URL path

#### Scenario: A refused locator names the spelling that works

- **WHEN** the model reads `https://example.test:1-5`, which no URL parser accepts because `1-5` is not a port
- **THEN** the read returns `invalid_path` naming `https://example.test/:1-5`, and resubmitting that reads lines 1 through 5 of the page
- **AND** reading `https://example.test/guide:12+` returns `invalid_selector` naming the `:N`, `:N-M`, `:N+K`, `:N-`, and `:-K` forms before the `%3A` spelling, while `https://example.test/guide:12-` reads line 12 through the render's last line
- **AND** a suffix outside the grammar with no line number in it, such as `https://w.example/wiki/Special:Search`, names the same forms and then the encoded spelling

#### Scenario: A selector the page cannot serve reports the page's length

- **WHEN** the model reads `https://example.test/guide:100-200` and the render is 3 lines long
- **THEN** the read returns `invalid_selector` reporting that the page rendered 3 lines
- **AND** the message does not repeat the error type as its text

#### Scenario: A local-only allow does not admit the web

- **WHEN** the `read` group's only allow clause is a `path` regex for `^/`
- **THEN** an `https://` locator matches no allow and is rejected as `no_allow` before any request

#### Scenario: Publisher signals are not permission

- **WHEN** a page's `robots.txt` disallows the path or its response carries `content-signal: ai-train=no`
- **THEN** an admitted read still fetches the locator and returns its content
- **AND** the read does not report or enforce the signal

#### Scenario: Read path clauses do not govern web search

- **WHEN** the `read` group has no allow for `^https://` and `tools.allowed`, `webSearch`, and `tools.permissions.web_search` admit `web_search`
- **THEN** a `web_search` call runs its engines and returns results
- **AND** a `read` of any returned `https://` URL is still rejected as `no_allow` before any request
