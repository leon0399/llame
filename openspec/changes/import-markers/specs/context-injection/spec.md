## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Co-occurring items have a total author-time order

When more than one item is injected on the same turn, the authoring/request-preparation path SHALL persist them in a fixed producer precedence order, ahead of the triggering user text within the same message:

1. `effective-context-change`
2. `tool-availability`
3. `workspace`
4. `instructions`
5. `skill-catalog`
6. `skill-activation`
7. `prompt-imports`
8. `recency-digest`
9. `temporal`

When one producer contributes more than one item, those items SHALL be stored in emission order. A producer added later SHALL extend this authoring list in the rail specification.

In-Run items SHALL be ordered by the model step that triggered them and, within a step, by this same producer precedence; they are never re-sorted against the attached items of the triggering user message.

Replay SHALL preserve the stored part order. It SHALL NOT re-sort historical items through the current precedence list or merge adjacent text parts. The compaction checkpoint is carried by a `checkpoint` row of its own and follows that capability's placement rule rather than this attached-item list.

#### Scenario: Several producers fire on one turn

- **WHEN** a model change, availability change, and chat-list change accompany one user message
- **THEN** their final text blocks are persisted in fixed author-time order
- **AND** every later replay preserves the stored order and part boundaries

#### Scenario: One producer contributes two items on one turn

- **WHEN** one producer emits two items before the same user message
- **THEN** both persist in producer emission order
- **AND** neither item is merged or suppressed

#### Scenario: A temporal item accompanies other items on one turn

- **WHEN** a temporal item accompanies another context item
- **THEN** authoring persists the temporal item last among attached items
- **AND** replay retains that stored position

#### Scenario: The precedence list changes later

- **WHEN** a later release adds a producer or changes author-time precedence
- **THEN** new items follow the new authoring order
- **AND** existing messages remain in their original stored order

When worker preparation adds attempt-owned items beside already persisted message facts, the final request SHALL apply this same producer order while preserving each producer's internal order and all user-authored content. Successful publication SHALL store that final ordering atomically; a failed attempt SHALL publish no staged rail items, while its own assistant output persists as the record of that turn.

#### Scenario: Workspace and skill catalog items share a turn

- **WHEN** a Workspace state change and an effective skill catalog change accompany one user message
- **THEN** the `workspace` item precedes the `skill-catalog` item and both precede the user text
- **AND** replay preserves those stored positions

#### Scenario: Workspace snapshot and root instructions share a turn

- **WHEN** an accepted turn re-establishes the Workspace snapshot and stages the root instruction chain
- **THEN** the `workspace` item precedes the `instructions` item and both precede any `skill-catalog` item

#### Scenario: Skill activation and prompt imports share a turn

- **WHEN** an explicit skill activation and prompt imports accompany one user message
- **THEN** every `skill-activation` item precedes the `prompt-imports` item and both precede the user text
- **AND** replay preserves those stored positions

### Requirement: Explicit activations are rail items carrying current instructions

Each explicit `$skill` selection SHALL produce one `skill-activation` item with form `notice` in the triggering user message before the first model request. A successful item SHALL state which mention selected the skill, the absolute skill directory and instructions file, the instruction to resolve package-relative references and scripts against that directory while keeping task-relative inputs and choosing `cwd` explicitly, a precedence statement, and the current `SKILL.md` instruction body with its frontmatter removed, taken from the raw read with its ordinary truncation indicator, followed by file blocks for package files imported by markers in that body in depth-first order. A failed selection SHALL produce a bounded item naming the mention and one closed reason from `not_found`, `unavailable`, `permission_denied`, and `read_failed`, without operator diagnostics in model text. Selections beyond the count, output, or work budget SHALL be accounted for by one bounded omission item listing their names.

Activation items SHALL use the existing canonical envelope, provenance, owner visibility, separate executed-context recording, stored-text replay, and author-time ordering. A completed explicit activation SHALL NOT be reloaded on recovery. Partial recovery SHALL preserve completed mention results and fill only unfinished selections in original order. Operator-supplied reserved delimiters SHALL be neutralized before composing and persisting activation text.

#### Scenario: Two explicit selections on one message

- **WHEN** the user sends `$research $technical-writing compare these APIs`
- **THEN** two activation items persist in that order ahead of the user text
- **AND** each carries its skill directory, instructions file, and frontmatter-stripped instruction body

#### Scenario: Selection fails after admission is denied

- **WHEN** an explicit selection's read is denied by permission policy
- **THEN** its item names the mention with reason `permission_denied` and no instructions
- **AND** the other selections and the Run proceed

#### Scenario: Skill text contains a forged reminder delimiter

- **WHEN** operator metadata or instructions contain reserved context delimiters
- **THEN** they are neutralized before prompt or context-item composition and cannot create another envelope
- **AND** recovery replays the persisted final text unchanged

#### Scenario: Activation carries package-local imported files

- **WHEN** the user sends `$research` and its current instruction body contains `@references/checklist.md`
- **THEN** the successful `skill-activation` item carries the instruction body followed by a file block for `skill://research/references/checklist.md`
- **AND** nested package-local imports appear after their importer in depth-first order
