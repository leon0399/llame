# native-file-tools

## Purpose

Provides one bounded native file interface for local coding and file-backed
Knowledge work, with exact edits, create-only writes, selector-based reads, and
future source/type extensions behind one result shape.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Native tools operate on absolute local regular files

The native `read`, `edit`, and `write` tools SHALL accept absolute local paths
and execute them with the trusted host process's OS authority in this alpha
capability, and SHALL accept `kb://` locators under the Knowledge locator
requirement. The scheme of the `path` argument SHALL select the authority; no
other argument or persisted declaration field SHALL. `edit` and `write` SHALL operate only on regular files. `read` SHALL
operate on regular files and directories; every other entry kind SHALL fail. A
`read` that misses a regular file SHALL offer bounded sibling-name
suggestions from its existing parent directory on every scheme, names only,
with one bounded directory read and bounded scoring work on the error path
and none on success; an absolute-path miss SHALL follow a symbolic-link
parent exactly as the read itself follows links. A
trailing path separator SHALL be accepted on a directory path and SHALL fail as
`not_found` on any other target. A model argument SHALL NOT select a different
executor, owner, tenant, permission mode, or remote authority. The three tools SHALL be advertised when the process has accepted native
host authority or has a configured Knowledge root; an absolute path on a
process without accepted native authority SHALL fail closed with
`executor_unavailable` rather than resolving through a hosted, Knowledge, or
Sandbox path. A Run
SHALL bind to the trusted native executor identity on its first absolute-path
operation, including `read`, and SHALL remain bound to it; a `kb://` operation
SHALL NOT bind or require an executor identity; a later reattachment
to another executor SHALL fail closed rather than resolving the physical path
there.

#### Scenario: Coding file is read by absolute path

- **WHEN** the model calls `read` with an existing absolute regular-file path
- **THEN** the native host reads that file using its OS authority
- **AND** the result identifies the absolute path and does not invent a Knowledge Space binding

#### Scenario: Absolute path without accepted native authority fails closed

- **WHEN** the process has a configured Knowledge root and no `tools.nativeExecutorId`, and the model calls `read` with an absolute path
- **THEN** the tool returns `executor_unavailable`
- **AND** it does not resolve the path through the Knowledge root or any other authority

#### Scenario: Missing or non-regular target fails

- **WHEN** `read`, `edit`, or `write` targets a missing entry, or a device, socket, FIFO, or other special entry
- **THEN** the tool returns a bounded structured error
- **AND** it does not follow a different path or invoke another executor

#### Scenario: A missed read suggests sibling names

- **WHEN** `read` targets a missing regular file, named without a trailing separator, whose parent directory exists, on any scheme
- **THEN** the `not_found` result also lists at most five entry names from that directory that score as plausible spellings of the requested name, as bare names without any path
- **AND** a miss with no plausible sibling, a trailing separator, or scoring work past its bound returns the bare `not_found`, and the suggestion list is never produced for `edit` or `write`

#### Scenario: A missed read under a missing parent says so

- **WHEN** `read` targets a path whose parent directory does not exist
- **THEN** the `not_found` result states that the parent directory is missing
- **AND** no entry of any other directory is listed

#### Scenario: Mutation on a directory fails

- **WHEN** `edit` or `write` targets an existing directory
- **THEN** the tool returns the `not_regular_file` error
- **AND** it does not create, rename, or modify any entry

#### Scenario: Trailing separator on a file fails

- **WHEN** `read` targets an existing regular file with a trailing path separator
- **THEN** the tool returns `not_found`
- **AND** it does not read the file

#### Scenario: Physical path is bound to one executor

- **WHEN** a later worker or host tries to continue a native Run with a different trusted executor identity
- **THEN** the native tool returns an executor-unavailable error
- **AND** it does not resolve the absolute path on the new host

### Requirement: Read selectors and context are deterministic

`read` SHALL accept trailing one-based inclusive selectors `:N-M`, `:N+K`,
`:raw`, and `:raw:N-M`, plus comma-separated selectors under the
multi-range requirement below. A valid selector SHALL be normalized once to
internal zero-based ranges. The tool SHALL recognize a `scheme://` prefix before
splitting a trailing selector, so a scheme's own colon is never read as a
selector. For absolute paths, existing literal paths SHALL take precedence over
selector parsing; a `kb://` path component SHALL NOT contain `:`, so the split is
unambiguous without probing. A `path` that begins with a `scheme://` prefix the
SHALL NOT be treated as a relative or literal filename. For regular-file reads, ordinary single bounded ranges SHALL include
one preceding and one following source line when available, and the extended
lines SHALL appear in the same `content` block as the requested lines. For single-range reads, result
details SHALL identify requested and shown ranges, representation, path, and
common truncation state. Requested bounds SHALL remain the normalized request
even when the displayed source ends earlier; shown bounds SHALL describe only
emitted source lines. Empty files SHALL return null ranges. `nextOffset` SHALL
identify the next requested source line. Raw reads SHALL return verbatim
selected source content without generated line prefixes, context expansion, or
processors. Directory reads SHALL apply single-range selectors to listing entries under the
directory listing requirements and SHALL NOT add context lines.

#### Scenario: Bounded read includes live adjacent lines

- **WHEN** the model reads lines 11 through 13 of a file with lines on both sides
- **THEN** content contains lines 10 through 14 in source order
- **AND** details identify requested range 11..13 and shown range 10..14

#### Scenario: Boundary range omits unavailable context

- **WHEN** a read starts at line 1 or ends at the file's last line
- **THEN** it omits the unavailable preceding or following context line
- **AND** it does not synthesize a blank source line

#### Scenario: Raw read is verbatim

- **WHEN** the model calls `read` with the `:raw` selector
- **THEN** the result contains the selected source bytes without line prefixes or generated helpers
- **AND** the result remains subject to the common output bounds, including the shared 2,000-line read ceiling

#### Scenario: Truncated result reports the shown range

- **WHEN** the common result limit prevents the complete requested/context range from fitting
- **THEN** the tool returns the ordinary truncation metadata and the content prefix it can fit
- **AND** it does not claim that omitted lines were observed

#### Scenario: Unknown scheme fails closed

- **WHEN** the model calls `read`, `edit`, or `write` with a path such as `vault://notes/a.md`
- **THEN** the tool returns `invalid_path`
- **AND** no file named `vault:` or `vault://notes/a.md` is read, created, or modified

#### Scenario: Directory range has no context lines

- **WHEN** the model reads a directory path with a range selector
- **THEN** content contains only the header line and the selected listing entries
- **AND** no entry outside the selected range is emitted

### Requirement: Multi-range reads return context-bounded intervals

A regular-file `read` SHALL accept two or more comma-separated `N-M` or `N+K`
ranges, or `raw:` followed by two or more comma-separated `N-M` ranges.
Every bound SHALL satisfy the existing positive safe-integer rules. Invalid
bounds and more than 64 input ranges SHALL fail with `invalid_selector`. Empty
members, whitespace, or malformed members SHALL fail the whole request under
existing error precedence: `invalid_selector` for parsed host selectors and
`invalid_path` for malformed `kb://` locator suffixes.
The tool SHALL sort ranges by start, merge overlapping or adjacent ranges,
expand each merged interval by one preceding and one following source line
when available, clip the expansion to the file bounds, and merge expanded
intervals that overlap or sit adjacent. Raw multi-range requests SHALL NOT
expand context. A comma-separated request SHALL report plural range fields
even if normalization and expansion leave one interval.
Absolute literal-path precedence and scheme-specific authorization SHALL apply
before reading as for existing selectors. Directory comma selectors SHALL fail
with `invalid_selector`; ordinary directory selectors SHALL remain unchanged.

Multi-range results SHALL replace singular `requestedRange` and `shownRange`
with `requestedRanges` and `shownRanges`, arrays of one-based inclusive
`{startLine, endLine}` intervals. `requestedRanges` SHALL retain the merged
pre-expansion request; `shownRanges` SHALL describe only emitted lines,
including expansion. Content SHALL concatenate selected source lines in source
order, using existing numbered rendering or verbatim raw rendering, without gap
markers. `representation`, `path`, and `truncated` SHALL retain their existing
meanings. On reaching EOF, shown ends SHALL clip to available source and later
ranges SHALL emit nothing; EOF alone SHALL NOT indicate truncation. A nonempty
file whose first requested start exceeds EOF SHALL fail with
`invalid_selector`. An empty file starting at line 1 SHALL return empty content
and empty arrays; other starts SHALL fail.

The existing serialized-result cap, including metadata and the authority's
envelope, and shared 2,000-line ceiling SHALL apply once to the entire result.
If the required metadata cannot fit, the call SHALL fail with `invalid_selector`.
The tool SHALL return a prefix of expanded ranges, favoring whole ranges:
after emitting one complete range, a subsequent range that cannot fit SHALL be
omitted in full and end the read. If the first range cannot fit, the tool SHALL
emit the complete source lines from its prefix that fit. An individually
oversized line SHALL be omitted and skipped without ending the read: the tool reports truncation and continues past it.
A truncated result's zero-based `nextOffset`, when present, SHALL identify the
first remaining selected line, skipping gaps and an individually oversized
line that cannot fit on retry. It SHALL be absent when no selected line remains.
A caller SHALL resume by trimming `requestedRanges` at `nextOffset + 1` and
re-running sort, merge, and expansion on the trimmed request, rather than
reading a continuous interval through gaps. Context lines MAY reappear across
retries, as in single-range continuations. Single-range result fields and
continuation SHALL remain unchanged.

#### Scenario: Touching expansions merge into one block

- **WHEN** a file read requests `:4-5,7-8`
- **THEN** the expansions 3..6 and 6..9 merge and content contains lines 3 through 9 exactly once
- **AND** requested ranges remain 4..5 and 7..8

#### Scenario: Unsorted overlapping ranges become one context-bounded block

- **WHEN** a file read requests `:20-30,5-10,10+10`
- **THEN** it merges the request to 5..30 and emits lines 4 through 31 exactly once, subject to file bounds
- **AND** requested ranges contain the interval 5..30 and shown ranges contain 4..31 when they fit

#### Scenario: Disjoint windows stay separate and raw reads stay verbatim

- **WHEN** a file read requests `:5-10,20-30` or `:raw:5-10,20-30`
- **THEN** the numbered read emits 4..11 and 19..31 as two shown ranges
- **AND** raw content has only lines 5..10 and 20..30 verbatim with no generated prefixes, context, or gap markers

#### Scenario: Later range waits for continuation

- **WHEN** `:5-10,20-30` fits the first expanded range but not all of the second
- **THEN** it emits only lines 4..11, reports truncation and `nextOffset: 18`
- **AND** a retry that trims `requestedRanges` at 19 reads `:20-30` with fresh expansion

#### Scenario: First range exceeds the line ceiling

- **WHEN** `:1-2500,4000-4010` targets a sufficiently long file with short lines
- **THEN** it emits lines 1..2000, reports truncation and `nextOffset: 2000`
- **AND** the remaining request is `:2001-2500,4000-4010`

#### Scenario: The line ceiling is shared across ranges

- **WHEN** `:1-1499,3000-4500` targets a sufficiently long file with short lines
- **THEN** it emits only lines 1..1500 because the second whole expanded range exceeds the remaining 500-line budget
- **AND** it reports truncation and `nextOffset: 2998`; a retry reads `:3000-4500`

#### Scenario: EOF limits shown ranges only

- **WHEN** a 25-line file is read with `:5-10,20-30,40-50` and output fits
- **THEN** requested ranges remain 5..10, 20..30, 40..50 and shown ranges are 4..11 and 19..25
- **AND** the result is not truncated and has no continuation

#### Scenario: First start past EOF fails despite context

- **WHEN** a 5-line file is read with `:6-7,20-25`
- **THEN** the tool returns `invalid_selector`
- **AND** no context line is emitted

#### Scenario: Expansion clips at the first line

- **WHEN** a file read requests `:1-2,5-6`
- **THEN** the expansions 1..3 and 4..7 merge and content contains lines 1 through 7 exactly once
- **AND** no line before line 1 is synthesized

#### Scenario: Invalid member rejects the request

- **WHEN** a nonliteral host read selector is `:5-10,,20-30`, `:5-10,0-2`, or contains 65 ranges
- **THEN** the tool returns `invalid_selector` without returning any selected content
- **AND** a malformed `kb://` suffix such as `:5-10,,20-30` retains `invalid_path`; valid comma grammar with invalid numeric bounds retains `invalid_selector`

#### Scenario: Literal filename wins

- **WHEN** `/tmp/report:5-10,20-30` exists as a regular file and is read
- **THEN** it is read as the literal filename without applying ranges

### Requirement: Directory reads return a deterministic bounded listing

When `read` targets an existing directory without a range selector, it SHALL
return a listing of that directory and its immediate child directories'
entries, two levels deep. The first content line SHALL be the header: the
directory path as given by the caller. The header SHALL NOT count as a listing
entry. Each entry SHALL be rendered on its own line, indented two spaces per
level below the requested directory, as `- name/` for a directory, `- name` for
a regular file, `- name@` for a symbolic link of any target kind, and
`- name?` for any other entry kind such as a FIFO, socket, or device. Symbolic
links found as entries SHALL NOT be descended, and special entries SHALL NOT be
opened or followed. A symbolic link given as the
target path SHALL resolve to its target directory as file reads resolve today.
Entries below the second level SHALL be counted but never rendered. A directory
with no entries SHALL render `(empty directory)` as its only line after the
header. Within one directory, entries SHALL be ordered with directories first
and then by name under the runtime's default `localeCompare`. Entries SHALL be shown verbatim:
hidden entries, ignore files, and entry metadata SHALL NOT alter the listing in
this iteration. The listing SHALL be a pure function of entry names, kinds,
counts, and that comparator, so two reads of an unchanged directory on one
host produce identical content. The comparator resolves against the runtime's
default locale, so ordering is stable per host rather than defined across
hosts. Result details SHALL identify the path and the
directory kind, and listing lines SHALL carry no generated line-number
prefixes.

#### Scenario: Vault structure is listed in one read

- **WHEN** the model reads a directory containing files, subdirectories, and a symbolic link
- **THEN** content starts with the header, lists directories before files at each level, renders each child directory's entries indented beneath it, and marks the symbolic link with `@` without listing anything beneath it

#### Scenario: Special entry is marked and never opened

- **WHEN** the model reads a directory containing a FIFO
- **THEN** the FIFO appears as `- name?` in order among the files
- **AND** the read completes without opening it

#### Scenario: Symbolic link target is listed

- **WHEN** the model reads a path that is a symbolic link to a directory
- **THEN** the result lists the target directory's entries
- **AND** the header is the path as given

#### Scenario: Empty directory

- **WHEN** the model reads a directory with no entries
- **THEN** content is the header followed by `(empty directory)`

#### Scenario: Listing is deterministic

- **WHEN** the model reads the same unchanged directory twice
- **THEN** both results have byte-identical content and details

### Requirement: Directory listing bounds favor the requested level

Each directory read for a listing, requested or child, SHALL retain at most
10,000 entry names for ordering while continuing to count entries beyond that
budget. A requested directory over the budget SHALL fail closed with a
`directory_too_large` error that states the count and no listing. A child
directory over the budget SHALL render only its `- name/` line followed by an
indented `… N entries` line with the exact count. Within that budget, the
requested directory's own entries SHALL NOT be capped by a per-level limit.
Each child directory SHALL render at most 20 entries in order, followed by one
`… N more` line stating the number of omitted entries when any were omitted.
When the rendered two-level listing exceeds the common native result cap, the
tool SHALL replace whole child blocks, last-first, where a child block is every
line rendered beneath one child directory including its `… N more` line, with
one indented `… N entries` line stating that child's total entry count; the
requested level's own lines SHALL be preserved by that step. An empty child
directory SHALL render as its `- name/` line alone, so a bare child line means
empty and an `… N entries` line means elided. The `… N entries` markers count toward the size of the requested level for
the next step but SHALL NOT occupy entry index positions. Only when the
requested level's entries and their markers still exceed the cap SHALL the tool
apply the ordinary truncation metadata over the requested-level entries in
order, each marker travelling with the entry it hangs from; `nextOffset` SHALL
identify the next requested-level entry index that was not emitted.
A range selector on a directory path SHALL switch the read to a flat listing of
the requested level: the header, then the selected entries by one-based entry
index, with no child entries and no context expansion, regardless of whether
the two-level listing would have fit. `nextOffset` SHALL identify the next
entry index of the requested level. The `:raw` selector on a directory SHALL
fail with a selector error.

#### Scenario: Requested directory over the traversal budget fails closed

- **WHEN** the model reads a directory holding more than 10,000 entries
- **THEN** the tool returns `directory_too_large` with the entry count
- **AND** it emits no listing

#### Scenario: Child directory over the traversal budget is elided

- **WHEN** a child directory holds more than 10,000 entries
- **THEN** the listing shows that child's `- name/` line followed by `… N entries` with the exact count
- **AND** no entry of that child is rendered

#### Scenario: Large child directory is summarized

- **WHEN** a child directory holds more than 20 entries
- **THEN** the listing shows its first 20 entries in order followed by `… N more` with the exact omitted count

#### Scenario: Oversized listing keeps the requested level

- **WHEN** the rendered two-level listing exceeds the common result cap but the requested level fits
- **THEN** whole child blocks are replaced last-first by `… N entries` lines until the listing fits
- **AND** every requested-level entry remains present with no partially rendered child block
- **AND** an empty child directory still renders as a bare `- name/` line

#### Scenario: Oversized requested level pages by selector

- **WHEN** the requested directory's own entries alone exceed the common result cap
- **THEN** the result carries the ordinary truncation details with `nextOffset`
- **AND** a range selector such as `:201-400` on the same directory returns the header and entries 201 through 400 of the requested level only

#### Scenario: Range selector on a small directory is flat

- **WHEN** the model reads a directory whose two-level listing fits the cap, with the selector `:1-5`
- **THEN** content is the header followed by the first five requested-level entries
- **AND** no child directory entries appear

#### Scenario: Raw selector on a directory is rejected

- **WHEN** the model reads a directory path with the `:raw` selector
- **THEN** the tool returns a selector error and no listing

### Requirement: Exact edit replaces one current unique match

`edit` SHALL accept an absolute path, non-empty `oldText`, and `newText`. It
SHALL read the current file at execution time and require exactly one exact
occurrence of `oldText`. A missing or ambiguous occurrence SHALL fail without
mutation. Unrelated changes elsewhere in the file SHALL NOT block a correct
unique replacement. Calls targeting the same path SHALL execute sequentially in
the host runtime. The operation SHALL preserve bytes outside the replacement and
return a bounded diff plus post-edit content with one adjacent live line on each
side when available. No prior read, snapshot tag, read hash, or permission rule
is required in this iteration.

#### Scenario: Unrelated change does not block edit

- **WHEN** another writer changes a different paragraph after the model read, while `oldText` remains one exact match
- **THEN** edit replaces the match and preserves the unrelated change

#### Scenario: Changed target fails without mutation

- **WHEN** another writer changes the exact old text before edit executes
- **THEN** edit returns a stale/missing-target error
- **AND** it does not write the replacement

#### Scenario: Duplicate target fails closed

- **WHEN** `oldText` occurs more than once
- **THEN** edit returns an ambiguity error with no mutation
- **AND** it does not replace every occurrence implicitly

#### Scenario: Sequential same-path calls are first-writer-wins

- **WHEN** two edit calls both request `-Foo +Bar` and `-Foo +Baz` against the same current bytes
- **THEN** the first call applies
- **AND** the second call observes the changed bytes and fails without overwriting the first result

### Requirement: Write creates only

`write` SHALL create a new regular file when the target is absent, creating
missing intermediate directories beneath the resolved authority root on every
scheme. It SHALL fail with `file_exists` when the target already exists,
regardless of the provided content, and with `not_regular_file` when an
intermediate path component exists and is not a directory. It SHALL validate UTF-8 content and enforce shared output limits. Native file size
SHALL NOT be restricted by the legacy Knowledge byte limit. It SHALL leave the
existing file unchanged on every failure.

#### Scenario: New file is created

- **WHEN** write targets an absent path with valid bounded content
- **THEN** the file is created atomically
- **AND** the result identifies the created target as the caller named it: the absolute path for an absolute path, the locator for a `kb://` write, never the resolved host path

#### Scenario: Missing intermediate directories are created

- **WHEN** write targets `research/2026/note.md` beneath a root where `research/` does not exist
- **THEN** the intermediate directories and the file are created
- **AND** an intermediate component that exists as a regular file fails with `not_regular_file` and creates nothing

#### Scenario: Existing file is protected

- **WHEN** write targets an existing file
- **THEN** the tool returns `file_exists`
- **AND** it does not overwrite or truncate that file

### Requirement: Native mutations have a durable pre-effect fence

Before an alpha native `edit` or `write` changes bytes on any scheme, the
trusted runtime SHALL durably record a stable mutation attempt identity and
target operation metadata. The recorded target for a `kb://` mutation SHALL be
the locator, never the resolved host path. Executor binding is an absolute-path
concern; a `kb://` attempt SHALL be fenced and replayed without binding the Run
to a worker.
If a retry or recovery observes an unsettled attempt, it SHALL return an unknown
outcome and SHALL NOT invoke the mutation again. A known result SHALL be settled
before the model advances. Client replay SHALL return the stored result without
executing the filesystem operation.

#### Scenario: Retry finds an open native mutation

- **WHEN** a worker dies after recording a native mutation attempt but before settling its result
- **THEN** recovery reports `outcome_unknown`
- **AND** a queue retry does not execute the same edit or write again

#### Scenario: Knowledge mutation is fenced on any worker

- **WHEN** a worker dies after recording a `kb://` edit attempt and a different worker retries the Run
- **THEN** recovery reports `outcome_unknown` on that worker
- **AND** the retry does not execute the edit again and does not fail with `executor_unavailable`

#### Scenario: Settled native mutation replays safely

- **WHEN** a client reconnects after a native mutation result was durably settled
- **THEN** replay returns the stored result
- **AND** the filesystem operation is not repeated

### Requirement: Knowledge locators resolve through trusted owner authority

`read`, `edit`, and `write` SHALL accept `kb://<space-id>/<path>[:selector]`,
where `<space-id>` is the stable Knowledge Space identifier and `<path>` is a
Knowledge-relative path. The tool SHALL resolve the identifier through the
trusted Run owner's current access immediately before opening the child, under
tenant enforcement, on every call. An absent, removed, malformed, or other-owner
identifier SHALL return the same closed `knowledge_space_not_found` result. A
currently owned Space whose root or stable-ID child cannot be resolved safely
SHALL return `knowledge_space_unavailable`. Neither result SHALL reveal whether
another owner, row, or directory exists, and the tool SHALL NOT probe candidate
Space directories. Sibling-name suggestions on a missed `kb://` read SHALL be
drawn only from a parent directory that has already been proven inside the
resolved Space, SHALL never be produced when the Space itself is absent,
removed, or another owner's, and SHALL carry names only; the parent SHALL be
checked without following links immediately before it is opened for names,
and a symbolic-link parent SHALL yield the bare `not_found`.

The locator SHALL be split on `/` and on the first `:` after the Space
identifier before any decoding, and each path segment SHALL then be
percent-decoded exactly once; the Space identifier and the selector SHALL NOT
be decoded. A segment that fails to decode, or that decodes to a string
containing `/`, SHALL return `invalid_path`, and that check SHALL run on the
individual segment before segments are rejoined. Where a path has a literal
spelling that is valid under this grammar, that spelling and its encoded
spelling SHALL resolve to the same file; a segment containing `:` or a
literal `%` has no valid literal spelling and SHALL be addressed as `%3A` or
`%25`, and `/` SHALL never be encoded. Path
validation SHALL apply to the decoded segments and SHALL reject absolute
paths, empty components, `.` or `..` components, backslashes, NUL or control
characters, and paths above 1,024 UTF-8 bytes or 32 components, returning
`invalid_path`. A `kb://` locator emitted by the system SHALL encode a segment
only when it contains `:`, `?`, `#`, or `%`, and SHALL leave every other
character, spaces included, literal. It SHALL refuse every
symbolic-link component or entry without following it, returning `not_found`.
`kb://<space-id>` and `kb://<space-id>/` SHALL address the Space's directory and
list it under the directory listing requirements; a bare `kb://` or a locator
with no identifier SHALL fail with `invalid_path`. Beyond those rules, `kb://`
targets SHALL follow the same regular-file, directory, selector, context,
truncation, mutation, and `file_exists` behavior as absolute paths. No
Markdown-only or per-file byte policy SHALL apply to `kb://` operations.

Every `kb://` result SHALL identify the target by its locator and SHALL carry
the response-time Knowledge Space identifier and display name. It SHALL expose
no configured root, resolved child path, hosted owner ID, credential, worker
identity, or raw filesystem diagnostic. Every successful `kb://` read or listing
SHALL include the Knowledge untrusted-content `notice`; content SHALL be returned
verbatim so that `edit` `oldText` can be copied from it once the generated
line-number prefixes are removed, or read with `:raw` to omit them.

The `kb://` grammar is the authority-aware locator that later schemes follow; a
scheme SHALL declare which of `read`, `edit`, and `write` it supports, and an
unsupported operation SHALL return a structured error without side effects.

#### Scenario: Search locator opens the passage

- **WHEN** the model calls `read` with a locator returned by `knowledge_search`, such as `kb://<id>/research/note.md:41-53`
- **THEN** the tool returns lines 41 through 53 with one adjacent context line on each side, numbered as native reads number them
- **AND** the result carries the Space identifier, display name, locator, and untrusted-content notice

#### Scenario: Another owner's Space is unresolvable

- **WHEN** the model supplies a locator whose identifier belongs to another owner
- **THEN** the tool returns `knowledge_space_not_found`
- **AND** the result is identical to the result for an absent identifier and no file is opened

#### Scenario: Locator carries no host authority

- **WHEN** a `kb://` read, edit, or write executes on a worker with no `tools.nativeExecutorId`
- **THEN** it resolves through the worker's configured Knowledge root and the Run owner
- **AND** it does not require or record an executor binding

#### Scenario: Space directory is listed

- **WHEN** the model calls `read` with `kb://<id>/`
- **THEN** the result is the deterministic two-level listing of the Space's directory with every entry shown as native listings show it
- **AND** the header is the locator as given

#### Scenario: Non-Markdown file is readable and writable

- **WHEN** the model writes `kb://<id>/data/table.csv` and then reads it back
- **THEN** both operations succeed under ordinary native semantics
- **AND** no Markdown-suffix or 1 MiB rule rejects either call

#### Scenario: Colon inside a Knowledge path is rejected

- **WHEN** the model calls `read` with `kb://<id>/notes/a:b.md`
- **THEN** the tool returns `invalid_path`, because a literal `:` after the identifier starts the selector and `b.md` is not one
- **AND** it does not probe for a literal file; the file is addressed as `kb://<id>/notes/a%3Ab.md`

#### Scenario: Encoded and literal spellings resolve alike

- **WHEN** the model calls `read` with `kb://<id>/01_Areas/Pet%20Projects/MOC.md` and then with `kb://<id>/01_Areas/Pet Projects/MOC.md`
- **THEN** both calls open the same file
- **AND** neither result reveals which spelling the filesystem holds

#### Scenario: Encoded separator cannot cross a boundary

- **WHEN** the model calls `read` with `kb://<id>/notes%2Fsecret.md`
- **THEN** the tool returns `invalid_path`
- **AND** `notes/secret.md` is not opened or probed, even though that literal path would be valid

#### Scenario: Malformed encoding fails closed

- **WHEN** the model calls `read` with `kb://<id>/reports/100%.md`
- **THEN** the tool returns `invalid_path`
- **AND** the description tells the model to write `%25` for a literal percent sign

#### Scenario: Edit copies verbatim content

- **WHEN** a note contains `<system>` in its text and the model reads it through `kb://` and then edits it using that text as `oldText`
- **THEN** the read returned the text unchanged
- **AND** the edit finds exactly one match and applies
